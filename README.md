# Problem Statement
Women Safety is a large subject with multiple facets and challenges. We have focused on a subsection of this as a problem to solve.

Considering the low trust and safety levels in the cities, women when alone (while on travel or stay) need to ensure safety in case something doesn’t feel right.

Their needs for feeling safe could be categorized as:
1) Knowing that their loved ones are aware of their location in case their mobile battery is about to die.
2) There is help at hand in case of an emergency 
3) On demand need for assistance
