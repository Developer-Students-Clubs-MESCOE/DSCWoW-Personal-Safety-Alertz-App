# DSCWOW_Personal-Safety-Alertz

Our app focuses on providing following functionalities:

<b>Instant message to close friends:</b> Whenever the userâ€™s battery falls below a certain limit(x%) our app automatically sends an SMS alert message to the trusted contacts saying that your phone battery is x% and is about to die, along with maps link of your current location. 

It is also possible to manually send an alert on just a single tap of the button, a pre-saved personalized text message along with the users current location will be sent directly as an SMS to the users trusted contacts.

<b>Emergency buttons:</b> In the need of emergency, the user can now easily call the police, ambulance or fire brigade, by clicking on respective emergency buttons without any hassle of dialing the numbers.
